      Hi! I'm David Klein, and I'm a designer.
   </h1>
   <p class="lh-copy">
      When I was 6 years old professional baseball star Will Clark called me a “dirtbag.” For any 6 year old that’s hard to take. But, even though a young child’s baseball ambition died face down in the mud that day, another dream was born in its place. I vowed that from that day forth, whatever I did, I would be the best I could. It’s this that spurs me on to be a great designer, to exceed expectations, to hit it out the park, so that one glorious day, when I run into Will Clark again, I can whip out my portfolio and say triumphantly “Hey Will, remember me? No? Err... Ok... Well... Do you need a website designed or anything?”

      For me, great design is about simplicity. I am driven to distill ideas down to their purest form. Simplicity is deceptive. It takes time to refine. But, for me it’s worth all the effort. I’ve worked with clients big and small, from ADT Pulse to Moovweb, but, whatever the job, I always apply the same level of commitment to my creative process.

      My passion for perfection filters into one of my other interests - coffee. I know a lot of people say they love coffee. But I’m obsessed with it. I spend an inordinate amount of time experimenting with beans, grinding equipment and brewing methods to in my attempt to make the perfect cup of Joe. I write regularly about coffee and my other interests over at my <a href="/journal" class="link black underline">journal</a>.

      If you have any thoughts, questions or recommendations I’d love to hear from you. Especially if your name’s Will Clark.
