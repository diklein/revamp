      When I was 6 years old professional baseball star Will Clark called me a “dirtbag.” For any 6 year old that’s hard to take. But, even though a young child’s baseball ambition died face down in the mud that day, another dream was born in its place. I vowed that from that day forth, whatever I did, I would be the best I could. It’s this that spurs me on to be a great designer, to exceed expectations, to hit it out the park, so that one glorious day, when I run into Will Clark again, I can whip out my portfolio and say triumphantly “Hey Will, remember me? No? Err... Ok... Well... Do you need a website designed or anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, great design is about simplicity. I am driven to distill ideas down to their purest form. Simplicity is deceptive. It takes time to refine. But, for me it’s worth all the effort. <a href="{{site.url}}/portfolio" class="blue link underline">I’ve worked with clients big and small</a>, but, whatever the job, I always apply the same level of commitment to my creative process.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion for perfection filters into one of my other interests — coffee. I know a lot of people say they love coffee. But I’m obsessed with it. I spend an inordinate amount of time experimenting with beans, grinding equipment and brewing methods in my attempt to make the perfect cup of Joe. I write regularly about coffee and my other interests over at my <a href="/journal" class="link blue underline">journal</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any thoughts, questions or recommendations I’d love to hear from you. Especially if your name’s Will Clark.

      How I Work
    </div>
    <p>
      My day begins with research, creative exploration and the perfect cup of coffee. There’s something about the methodical process of preparing my morning coffee sets me up for the day ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each project is an exciting opportunity to not just deliver on expectations, but exceed them. So when I start working with a new client, I ask a lot of questions from the outset. I want to be be confident we’re on the same page.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love to collaborate with clients and am fascinated by how two ideas can combine to create something new. I welcome conversations throughout the development process. If you ever need me my Skype window is always open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes designers can get carried away with the details and lose sight of the overall goal, but, to me, good design is the execution of thoughtfulness. I keep the user in mind as I work and ultimately aim to simplify their experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I am very methodical and organised in my work, my desk is decorated with things that inspire me. I never leave a wall blank. Away from my desk I enjoy watching stand up comedy and movies, listening to my favorite podcasts, and exercising regularly. These hobbies keep my mind active and feed back into my work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately I’m passionate about what I do. To me design is much more than just work and I won’t rest until I deliver something that you truly love.
