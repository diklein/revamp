        There’s a certain emotion I rarely feel, and when I do I know I’ll never forget it. It’s a combination of both extreme happiness and extreme sadness. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. For example, at the end of a movie a man and a woman get together after waiting for a decade or two since one chose the wrong person to marry and the other was forced to move on. You’re happy that they finally made it, but also sad that they wasted so much time with the wrong people. I can’t explain why I get tremendous pleasure from this. Only a few books and movies have helped me achieve this emotion.

        I can add a new item to that short, special list: <span class="i">Splendor in the Grass</span>. It stars Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood as young adults who fall in love.

        This movie has qualities I don’t really see anymore from Hollywood: acting, spirit, and passion. Not only did it move me, but I finally got to feel that emotion again.
