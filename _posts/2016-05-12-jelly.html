      I played with Jelly a few times in 2014 when it first launched because I was interested to see what one of Twitter’s co-founders, Biz Stone, would come up with next. Jack Dorsey famously co-founded Square after leaving Twitter, and Evan Williams founded Medium.

      With Jelly 1.0 I remember asking a question with a photo, and receiving a few immature answers from people I didn’t know. I believe the goal was to connect your questions to friends’ friends on Twitter and Facebook.
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy">
      The app faded away somewhat quickly. <a href="https://medium.com/the-biz-stone-collection/introducing-jelly-a-new-search-engine-47e2594ad3ff#.qaql42fph" class="link black underline">Now, it’s back</a>. I’m going to write my thoughts about the iOS app as I play. Perhaps I’ll write about the web app another day. Let’s take a look.

      “Jelly uses your connections across social networks to supply quick replies to all your quandaries.” Quandaries. Great word. It also sounds like I’m going to post questions to people I know on Twitter and Facebook similar to the old Jelly. <span class="i black-60">This is David 20 minutes in the future.

      "Ask Jelly anything–questions are always anonymous. And answer questions to help people out." This might be a bit picky, but why start the second sentence with a conjunction? I'm also still curious as to why Jelly continues to push anonymity. Is it for my comfort? The opposite occurs for me. I assume that I'm going to see an unregulated hodgepodge. Perhaps the Jelly team is betting that people will ask more honest questions if they are allowed to do so anonymously.

         Excessive Drop Shadow Button
      </div>
      Why use a white field with a giant drop shadow? I think a 1pt green border would accomplish the “hey tap on me” goal. It would also solidify that green means tap. Honestly, I’m not a huge fan of the excessive drop shadow trend we are currently seeing. It feels particularly odd on iOS.
   </p>
   <p class-"lh-copy">
      The text in the excessive drop shadow button just says “Ask Jelly.” Ask Jelly what? There’s some explanatory text below that says to ask anything. Why not make that the default text in the excessive drop shadow button “Ask Jelly anything?” That would be much clearer.
I’ll try asking a question in a minute. Also, from now on I’ll say EDS instead of Excessive Drop Shadow.

      Tapping “Learn more about Jelly” takes me to a web browser with, what I like to call, Dropbox-style illustrations. They’re friendly and cute, but they don’t feel confident. They feel a bit too sketch-like (sketch with a pencil – not the application).

      </div>
      Oh look! Now I see why the button has an EDS. When you scroll, the button floats on top of the content. I think transitioning from a 1pt green border to no border with an EDS would accomplish the goal of indicating that I should tap on that button when I arrive on the screen, and I can continue to tap on it after scrolling. I believe in design context wins over consistency. Therefore, make the button’s design fit the context: green border when I arrive, and EDS when I scroll.

      The first question I see is “What’s your favorite national park in the US?” This is the moment I realized how the answer’s visual design is virtually identical to a comment on Medium. I know there are 4 answers, but I can only see 1 from “Katelyn.” The first answer Jelly shows me is from a user who has no avatar, and who has only contributed 2 “helpful answers.” This is a great opportunity to showcase the power of Jelly. Instead, I see a 1 word answer: “Yosemite.” That’s it? No reason? No story? This is pretty underwhelming. Also the first question is just a chance to share opinions instead of a situation where a user "delivers an answer and saves time."

   <p class-"lh-copy">
      “Yosemite I guess.” The interesting part is the subtle “How do you know?” field. I suppose this means I can provide some proof that I know what I’m talking about. This is another missing piece of data from the first question Jelly showed me. How did Katelyn know that Yosemite is her favorite national park? But that doesn’t make sense either because one can’t know an opinion.

      When I try to submit my answer, Jelly wants me to sign up. The first thing Jelly wants to know about me is my full name. After my name, the app asks me for my email address and a password. That’s 2 things right? The app says “One last thing” but then asks for 2 things. Hmm.

      There’s a “Post” button that I assume allows me to post this answer outside of Jelly. Unfortunately, I’m mistaken. The “Post” button is my opportunity to comment on an answer. This doesn’t make any sense. There’s a reply icon next to “Post,” so I after pondering for a moment I realized [reply icon] + “Post” = comment. This is a big mental leap. Don’t be clever with copy. Just say “Comment.”

      Now that I’ve signed up, I’m taking a look at the feed. At this point Jelly doesn’t know who my friends are, if I have friends on the app, or what my interests are. The feed is just a list of random questions. I can’t imagine a situation in which I’m bored and I would think, “Let me see what questions I can answer.” Back in the days of Aardvark, I would receive an email when someone asked a question about a topic that I claimed to know about. Here? Randomness.

      Notifications are always more complicated than people expect. If you are actively using an app, push notifications from that app do not appear. As a result it’s beneficial to design and build custom in-app notifications. Jelly has them with a nice horizontal line that tells me I can grab the area and slide it up to dismiss it. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work. You can only tap on the bar to dismiss it. I waited several seconds for it to disappear automatically, but it didn’t. I think an in-app notification should animate off screen after a few seconds so it doesn't block content.

   <p class="lh-copy">
      After entering the question some photos were suggested. I don’t know where they came from, and they’re pretty bad. I can use my own photo by tapping on a tiny, vague icon. There’s plenty of space for “My photos” and “Camera.” Again, don’t be clever. If there’s room for text, use text. You can also use 2 icons: the current icon, and a camera icon. This allows me to jump directly to the action I want.

         Summary

      I asked a decently complicated question about coffee, and I received some nice answers. However, I’m not sure how Jelly can be a better resource than searching for questions on Quora (which I hear some people still do), or just searching Google. What about looking up coffee kits on Kit? Or asking on Facebook? After designing and launching Trullo, I kept asking myself, "How can I get people to do x on my app instead of Facebook?" I believe Jelly needs to answer this question as well.

   <p class="lh-copy">
      The overall design is pleasant. The designer(s) focused heavily on typography, and I appreciate the nod to Medium’s aesthetic.
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy">
      The flows are simple. There’s really only a few screens in the entire app. Keeping it simple (stupid) is hard, and I respect when a team accomplishes this.
