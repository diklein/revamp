description: I’ve met a couple people who have Synesthesia. They claim that colors
  appear in their mind when they hear certain sounds (or vice versa). I reflect on
  this often because for most of my life I believe I suffer from a very similar phenomenon
  that I aptly named Cinemathesia.

      Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.

      I’ve met a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3028742/whos-next/whos-next-keezy-video" class="blue link underline">couple people</a> who have Synesthesia. They claim that colors appear in their mind when they hear certain sounds (or vice versa).

      Emotions experienced during a movie earlier in life can be triggered with their original potency by just a few musical notes. A great example is the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108002/" class="blue link underline">Rudy</a>, which arguably has one of the best <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rudy-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B0000014TQ" class="blue link underline">original soundtracks</a> in the history of film. A couple specific horn sounds instantly bring me back to the first time I watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n88hXH6_-AU" class="blue link underline">tryouts scene</a>. I can sense the pressure Rudy is under to impress the coaches. The joy from seeing him on the Notre Dame field washes over me. I can close my eyes and feel the bass from all the times Rudy is brutally tackled.

      People have always accused me of having an uncanny ability to quote movies with shocking detail. Little did they know I can also quote emotions.
