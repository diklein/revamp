      When I was a grad student at Cornell in 2006, Professor Bailey and I talked at great length about computers accompanying musicians. I visited Cornell in 2010, and immediately emailed him to grab coffee. Four hours later we were deep in discussion once again only this time the topic was conference calls. This video seems to piece it all together nicely. I can’t wait to see how his ideas progress.

      He was by far the most entertaining and thought-provoking lecturer I had, and the only Professor who took the time to teach me how to play Sudoku.
