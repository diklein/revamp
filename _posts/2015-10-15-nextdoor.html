        Although <a href="https://nextdoor.com/" class="blue link underline">Nextdoor</a> has recently received some <a href="https://pando.com/2015/03/30/the-racists-next-door-why-nextdoors-racial-profiling-problem-isnt-the-companys-fault-its-societys/" class="blue link underline">negative publicity</a>, I'm hooked. Mounting my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/EO1-Black-by-Electric-Objects/dp/B00X98OMKE" class="blue link underline">E01</a> required a drill which, of course, I do not own. I posted on Nextdoor that I needed to borrow one, and within a few minutes I received a response. Amazing.

        Warning: it's a pretty depressing app. Most of the posts are related to vandalism and theft.
