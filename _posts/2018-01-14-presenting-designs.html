        I begin each critique by explaining and demonstrating the problem, and then I present <span class="b">one</span> solution. I usually include a few edge-case mockups and Principle animations to ensure the team thoroughly comprehends the proposal.
     </p>
     <p>
       However, the team doesn't know I have a Sketch file up my sleeve. It's <span class="b">crucial</span> to keep every iteration and have the ability to explain why the presented solution is ideal. If you have enough iterations you can be ready when the team inevitably asks <span class="i">"What if you tried x"</span> questions.
     </p>

       Marc asks what one does to help stakeholders reach a decision because there is no guarantee that the team will agree with your proposal. You will receive both high-level and pixel-level feedback. Never take it personally. You are all trying to achieve the same goal: make your customers successful. When you receive feedback you must <span class="b">take notes</span>. I usually flip between Google Slides and <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" class="blue link underline">Things</a>. The team will appreciate watching you carefully write down their suggestions.
     </p>
     <p>
       Do not immediately reject what your team suggests. Note it and then <span class="b">reflect</span> after the meeting. There's a good chance you do not fully understand the suggestion or your gut reaction is mistaken. When you present updated mockups and animations in a future meeting, take extra time to explain why the team's suggestions did or didn't work. This shows thoughtfulness and your team will appreciate it. By including stakeholders in the design process you will converge on a solution over time.
