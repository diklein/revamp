      Hungry. I decided to grab a <a href="https://www.soylent.com/product/coffiest/" class="link blue underline">Coffiest</a>. Below is my tale.
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy">
      First, I appreciate the minimalist packaging design. The label can be summarized by Coffiest, caffeine, l-theanine, soylent, and 400 kcal.
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy">
      Now, to be clear, I am a self-described coffee expert. However, I do not believe that my expertise will be relevant or helpful during this experience. I assume Coffiest will not be very coffee-like. Let's find out.

   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b pb0">
         First sip
      </div>
      <ul>
         <li>Attack: Oh god. This tastes like what I think mud would taste like.</li>
         <li>Evolution: Okay I guess it's just a shake.</li>
         <li>Finish: Well that's over, Phew.</li>
         <li>Aftertaste: Oh there's a shtickle of coffee. Interesting.</li>
      </ul>
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b pb2">
         Second sip
      </div>
      I think I’m getting used to this. Does that make me a tech bro? A brosigner? Should I call my rabbi?
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b pb2">
         Third sip
      </div>
      Oh wait does this mean I can’t eat lunch today? This is supposed to be an entire meal right?
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b pb2">
         Fourth sip
      </div>
      This is about as coffee-tasting as a mocha frappuccino. Although I would rather have a mocha frappuccino. They taste good and make me feel happy.
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b pb2">
         Fifth sip
      </div>
      Do you still care? Do I?
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b pb2">
         Sixth sip
      </div>
      I don’t feel hungry anymore. Does that mean my body is freaking out or satisfied?
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b">
         Seventh sip
      </div>
      Honestly, I’ll pixel-fit any icons people send to me.
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b pb2">
         Eighty sip
      </div>
      It’s thick, but not too thick. It’s adequate, but not too adequate.
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b pb2">
         Ninth sip
      </div>
      Should I tell people I tried soylent? What will my girlfriend think? What will my mom think? Oh god what will my dogs think?!
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b pb2">
         Tenth sip
      </div>
      Could it be? Is my hairline extending? No you’re just seeing things again.
   </p>
   <p class="lh-copy pt4">
      <div class="b pb2">
         Eleventh sip
      </div>
      Fin. I did it. A ladybug seriously landed on my shoulder as I finished my first Soylent. That must be significant. I suppose I’ll complete the twelve pack.

      My heart rate increased. I hope that’s the caffeine! This is my second cup of the day. This morning I made a delightful cup of Brasil Serra Negra from Passion House Coffee Roasters on the V60. Perhaps two caffeinated items before lunch time is a mistake for someone my age.

      Also, my mouth feels a little slimy. Time to grab a La Croix and flex some Sketch.
