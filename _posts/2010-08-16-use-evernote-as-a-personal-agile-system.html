      At work we have been slowly transitioning to an agile development methodology, and it’s growing on me. Break a feature down into tasks. Closely track them. Complete.

      Recently, I had an epiphany. Why not try to use Evernote in a similar way to manage my personal life? Well, here's what I came up with.
    </p>
    <hr class="center mw4 mv5"/>
    <span class="b">Create Three Notebooks</span>
    <p>
      Backlog, Current, and Done. I chose these words because they appear in alphabetical order in Evernote. I’d prefer to use In Progress instead of Current, but Evernote won’t let you manually change the order.

    <span class="b">Create Tasks</span>
    <p>
      This is an example task for a college student (specifically a Cornell undergrad who is currently enrolled in Econometrics). I broke it down into the usual college paper sub-tasks: read, outline, write, review, submit. I also added a “ToDo” checkbox for each sub-task so I can keep track of my progress on the overall task.
    </p>

    </section>
    <span class="b">Shift Tasks Between Notebooks</span>
    <p>
      Once you’re ready to begin working on the Econ 321 Paper task, drag it from the Backlog notebook into the Current notebook. As you complete each sub-task, mark it done using a checkbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now your paper is done and you’ve emailed it to your Professor (or lovely TA). Drag the task to Done.
    </p>
    <p>
      There you go. Evernote + Agile = Awesome.
    </p>

      David from the future: One should really create a backlog of tasks, estimate number of minutes of hours for each, commit to a specific number of tasks, set up sprints, and then calculate personal volicity. Wait. Is "Personal Velocity" a good name for a band?
